# Fine-tuning the pretrained T5 transformer model for abstractive summary of text

This is based on a tutorial video on YouTube by "Venelin Valkov" ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyZUIraHio&t=1287s").
This can be used to fine-tune this highly powerful transformer for summarization task which is already pretrained on C4 dataset of 750GB of text.
Please chech the notebook.
